# SnakeJS
##### Front end library for JavaScript, created by a water drinker for water drinkers.

### What is it?
SnakeJS is a library that will allow you to access the client's functionalities in a more friendly way, that is, the browser, it also gives you a new way of writing the code, it will be friendly for C # developers or Google Open Source contributors in their monsters of C / C ++.

It offers you a lot of functionality to form an incredible page with a unique interaction with the client, it offers you most of the available listeners, different ways in which you can declare styles to your nodes and the possibility of creating your own Single system Pages Applications using client-related objects.

### Other deliveries
SnakeJS includes ZendaJS Z8, JavaScript implementation that has new functionality and expands native language object methods incorporated by the engine that the browser is using, includes method extensions for Strings, Arrays, Maths and data structures, you don't have to read an extensive, ugly and boring documentation to understand how this works, you can go to the example files and find out how Z8 works by analyzing the example files or you can go to the ZendaJS repository and analyze the explanation of the Z8, also not only It allows you to have these extensions if not you can use them as you want because these algorithms that allow you to do magic are in the 'SnakeAlgorithms' object in which you are free to use all the functionalities that it offers.

### Installation
To install and use the library in your projects you only need to clone the repository and simply the only .js whose name is Snake to your .html haha, nothing to write home about, just be careful if you want to see the example files because they do a Import relative to the library, make a copy of it and put it in your project in case you want to analyze the sample files.

```bash
git clone https//github.com/codewithrodi/SnakeJS/ # Clone SnakeJS repository
cd SnakeJS # Enter the directory
```
## Contributing
SnakeJS was only created to test my skills with the interaction of the client and browser using JavaScript, I hope to update my library a lot, I think it is a good way to standardize my projects using this library, but on the other hand I find it ridiculous that in 2021 they continue to be used this type of libraries when JavaScript on the client side is super understandable and easy to manipulate, but anyway, it can help you learn <3.
